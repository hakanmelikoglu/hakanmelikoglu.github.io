  <h1>Privacy Policy for Baby Tracker</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 4, 2024</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Baby Tracker ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Baby Tracker application (the "App").</p>

  <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>Baby Tracker is designed with your privacy in mind. To be clear:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not collect any personal information about you or your baby.</li>
    <li>We do not track your location.</li>
    <li>We do not store or upload your baby's data or photos.</li>
    <li>We do not use analytics services.</li>
    <li>We do not have any third-party trackers.</li>
    <li>We do not share any data with third parties.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Stored Locally</h2>
  <p>All data you enter into Baby Tracker, including but not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Feeding records and schedules</li>
    <li>Sleep tracking data and nap times</li>
    <li>Diaper change logs and patterns</li>
    <li>Growth measurements and milestones</li>
    <li>Health records, vaccinations, and doctor visits</li>
    <li>Photos and memories</li>
    <li>Notes and observations</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data is stored exclusively on your device using local storage mechanisms provided by iOS. All data processing occurs entirely on your device:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No baby data or photos are ever transmitted outside your device.</li>
    <li>Data is not stored by our servers; it only exists locally on your device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All app preferences and settings are stored locally on your device.</li>
    <li>Your data is protected by iOS device security features including Face ID, Touch ID, and device passcode.</li>
    <li>Data is protected by iOS App Sandbox security model and local encryption.</li>
    <li>Purchase records for Pro features (one-time purchase or subscriptions) are managed entirely through Apple's App Store system. We do not receive or store any payment information directly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Backup and Sync</h2>
  <p>If you choose to use iCloud backup, your Baby Tracker data may be included in your device's iCloud backup. This is controlled entirely by your iOS settings and Apple's iCloud service, not by our app. We have no access to or control over this backup process.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our app is designed for parents and caregivers to track their children's information. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. All data in the app is entered by the parent, guardian, or authorized caregiver.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access your data (stored locally on your device).</li>
    <li>Delete any data by uninstalling the app or using the app's data deletion features.</li>
    <li>Export your data using the app's built-in export functionality.</li>
    <li>Control your data completely since it never leaves your device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Compliance</h2>
  <p>We are committed to maintaining compliance with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Apple's App Store Guidelines</li>
    <li>GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)</li>
    <li>CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)</li>
    <li>COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Because we do not collect or store any personal data on our servers, compliance obligations are minimal. We ensure that we do not engage in any practices that would conflict with these regulations.</p>

  <h2>Transparency</h2>
  <p>We believe in complete transparency about our data handling practices. Our App is designed to respect your privacy by processing everything locally on your device. We do not have servers, do not collect analytics, and do not monetize your data in any way.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any changes, we will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page and post the new Privacy Policy here. Your continued use of the App after any changes indicates your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
