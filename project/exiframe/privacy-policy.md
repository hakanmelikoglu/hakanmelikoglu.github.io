  <h1>Privacy Policy for EXIFrame</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 4, 2024</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>EXIFrame ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our EXIFrame application (the "App").</p>

  <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>EXIFrame is designed with your privacy in mind. To be clear:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not collect any personal information.</li>
    <li>We do not track your location.</li>
    <li>We do not store or upload your photos.</li>
    <li>We do not use analytics services.</li>
    <li>We do not have any third-party trackers.</li>
    <li>We do not share any data with third parties.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Photo Access and Processing</h2>
  <p>EXIFrame may require access to your device's photo library solely for the purpose of reading EXIF data and processing images. All photo processing occurs entirely on your device:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No photos or EXIF data are ever transmitted outside your device.</li>
    <li>Photos are not stored by the App; they are only processed in temporary memory to provide you with the requested features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All app preferences and settings are stored locally on your device.</li>
    <li>Purchase records for Pro features (one-time purchase or subscriptions) are managed entirely through Apple's App Store system. We do not receive or store any payment information directly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect data at all, there is no specific risk to children's privacy.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access your data (though we do not collect any).</li>
    <li>Delete any data (though we do not store any).</li>
    <li>Opt out of data collection (we do not collect any data to opt out of).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Compliance</h2>
  <p>We are committed to maintaining compliance with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Apple's App Store Guidelines</li>
    <li>GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)</li>
    <li>CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Because we do not collect or store any personal data, compliance obligations are minimal. We ensure that we do not engage in any practices that would conflict with these regulations.</p>

  <h2>Transparency</h2>
  <p>We believe in complete transparency about our data handling practices. Our App is designed to respect your privacy by processing everything locally on your device. We do not have servers, do not collect analytics, and do not monetize your data in any way.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any changes, we will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page and post the new Privacy Policy here. Your continued use of the App after any changes indicates your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
