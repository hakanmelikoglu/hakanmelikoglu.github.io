TERMS OF USE (EULA)
*Last updated: December 10, 2024*

Welcome to EXIFrame (the “App”), provided by Hakan Melikoglu (“we,” “us,” or “our”). By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms of Use and End-User License Agreement (collectively, the “Terms”). If you do not agree, please do not use the App.

1. License Grant
We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App solely for your personal, non-commercial purposes. You agree not to reproduce, distribute, modify, create derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, republish, download, store, or transmit the App or any portion thereof, except as permitted by these Terms.

2. In-App Purchases and Subscriptions
EXIFrame offers both one-time purchases and auto-renewable subscription options for additional features and content.
	•	Lifetime In-App Purchase: One-time purchase for USD $7.99. This grants you lifetime access to the designated premium features without expiration.
	•	Monthly Subscription: USD $0.99 per month. This subscription will unlock premium features on a monthly, auto-renewing basis.

2.1 Billing and Auto-Renewal
For the monthly subscription, payment will be charged to your Apple ID account upon purchase confirmation. The subscription automatically renews each month at the stated price unless you turn off auto-renewal at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the cost of the chosen plan.

2.2 Managing Your Subscription
You can manage your subscription or turn off auto-renewal at any time by accessing your account settings in the App Store. Turning off auto-renew will prevent future charges but will not result in a refund of the current subscription period.
