# Privacy Policy for EXIFrame
*Last updated: December 4, 2024*

## Introduction
EXIFrame ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our EXIFrame application (the "App").

## Information We Don't Collect
EXIFrame is designed with your privacy in mind. We want to be clear that:
- We do not collect any personal information
- We do not track your location
- We do not store or upload your photos
- We do not use analytics services
- We do not have any third-party trackers
- We do not share any data with third parties

## Photo Access and Processing
- The App requires access to your photo library solely to read EXIF data and process images locally on your device
- All photo processing happens entirely on your device
- No photos or EXIF data are ever transmitted outside your device
- Photos are not stored by the App; they are only processed in temporary memory

## Data Storage
- All app preferences and settings are stored locally on your device
- Purchase records for Pro features are managed through Apple's App Store system

## Children's Privacy
Our App does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13 years of age.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
